# Configuration file for GNU GLOBAL source code tagging system.
#
# Basically, GLOBAL doesn't need this configuration file ('gtags.conf'),
# because it has default values in itself. If you have this file as
# '/etc/gtags.conf' or "$HOME/.globalrc" then GLOBAL overwrite the default
# values with values in the file.
# Configuration file is also necessary to use plug-in parsers.
#
# The format is similar to termcap(5). You can specify a target with
# GTAGSLABEL environment variable. Default target is 'default'.
#
# If you want to have default values for yourself, it is recommended to
# use the following method:
#
# default:\
#	:tc=default@~/.globalrc:\	<= includes default values from ~/.globalrc.
#	:tc=native:
#
# Please refer to gtags.conf(5) for details.
